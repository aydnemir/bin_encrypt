This is an implementation of the AES algorithm, specifically ECB, CTR and CBC mode.
Block size can be chosen in aes.h - available choices are AES128, AES192, AES256.

The implementation is verified against the test vectors in:
National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-38A 2001 ED

This project use for reading from binary file then writing created a new file with aes encryption.
